A Substance Painter DDS export plugin to automate the PNG to DDS conversion.

Original code made by Emil for Starfield - https://github.com/emomilol1213/Substance-Painter-DDS-Exporter Modified by Casey for use in KCD2.

No more spending 20 minutes manually converting those 20 different maps to DDS via tedious steps in PS/Intel/Paint.net etc

# Installation:
Extract the KCD2-dds-exporter.py into your Substance Painter Plugin folder:
<pre>
C:\Users\username\Documents\Adobe\Adobe Substance 3D Painter\python\plugins
</pre>

(Can also be found using the Python > Plugins Folder button in the top row)

## Export preset:
Move the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Export.spexp from the optional files to this folder: 
<pre>
C:\Users\username\Documents\Adobe\Adobe Substance 3D Painter\assets\export-presets
</pre>

## Enable the KCD2-DDS-Exporter under the Python menu
First time running the plugin it will ask you what folder the Texconv.exe is located in via a UI pop-up. This will create a KCD2-DDS-Exporter-PluginSettings.ini in the plugin folder with the settings saved.
